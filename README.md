# cs_1_connect4_ai
instructions for use are largely contained in README.txt

simulates a Connect 4 game, and has an AI that plays using a minimax algorithm of adjustable depth with alpha-beta pruning that uses an adjustable number of Monte Carlo simulations at each endpoint in the resulting tree - however, it does not save this tree across each move of the game

this won the first prize in the competition between such AIs in CS 1 2016 at Caltech and I'm low key pretty proud of that

runtime naturally varies based on machine, but the default settings in the config file make it difficult to beat but relatively slow to run
